Hello jii , 

This is a real time chat application based on socket.io .

In this application , you can join the live chat using your name and start chatting-->>

You will have access to some previous messages,
Your messages are getting stored in the database,
You can check live connected users in the Users bar,
You will recieve a notification when a new user joins or a user leaves,
You can see the user who is typing,
You will get notification sound when there is a new messsage or new user joins,
There is a very basic stying done , I am not so good with that ,so please don't mind it.

There were lot of challenges during this project , it was fun ...
... I will surely enhance it later after learning React.js.....till then , BYE.


Thank you,
Prashant Agrawal
